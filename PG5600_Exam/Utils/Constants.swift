// One spot for the CompletionHandlers so it can be changed easily at one place + for readability
typealias FilmResponseCompletion = (FilmsList?) -> Void
typealias CharacterResponseCompletion = (People?) -> Void

// Would add other global variables here like URLs etc, decided for the URLs it was easier to read when it was directly in the local code instead of split up
